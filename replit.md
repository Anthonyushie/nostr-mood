# Nostr Mood Analyzer

## Overview

This is a full-stack TypeScript application that analyzes the sentiment of Nostr posts. The application allows users to input a Nostr post ID (in various formats) and performs sentiment analysis on the post content. It's built as a modern web application with a React frontend and Express backend, designed for analyzing mood and sentiment in the decentralized Nostr social network.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

The application follows a monorepo structure with a clear separation between client, server, and shared code:

- **Frontend**: React-based single-page application with modern UI components
- **Backend**: Express.js server with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM (configured but not fully implemented)
- **Shared**: Common schemas and types used by both client and server
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui component library

## Key Components

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state management
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui component library built on Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design tokens for dark theme
- **Build Tool**: Vite with custom configuration for development and production

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Database ORM**: Drizzle ORM configured for PostgreSQL
- **Database Provider**: Neon Database (@neondatabase/serverless)
- **Session Storage**: PostgreSQL session store (connect-pg-simple)
- **Development**: Hot reloading with tsx

### Core Features
- **Nostr Integration**: Uses nostr-tools library for Nostr protocol interaction
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Client-side sentiment analysis using the 'sentiment' library
- **Post ID Validation**: Supports multiple Nostr post ID formats (hex, bech32)
- **Relay Communication**: Connects to multiple Nostr relays for post retrieval

### UI/UX Design
- **Theme**: Dark mode optimized with custom HSL color system
- **Components**: Comprehensive set of accessible UI components
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first responsive design
- **Accessibility**: Built with Radix UI primitives for accessibility compliance

## Data Flow

1. **User Input**: User enters a Nostr post ID in various supported formats
2. **Validation**: Frontend validates and normalizes the post ID format
3. **Nostr Query**: Application connects to Nostr relays to fetch the post content
4. **Sentiment Analysis**: Client-side sentiment analysis using the sentiment library
5. **Results Display**: Sentiment scores and analysis are displayed with visual indicators

### Database Schema
Currently defined schema includes:
- **Users table**: Basic user management with username/password authentication
- The schema is prepared for future expansion with additional features

## External Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- **Nostr Protocol**: nostr-tools for Nostr network interaction
- **Database**: @neondatabase/serverless for PostgreSQL connectivity
- **ORM**: drizzle-orm for type-safe database operations
- **UI Framework**: Extensive Radix UI component collection
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with class-variance-authority for component variants
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for efficient data fetching and caching

### Development Tools
- **Build**: Vite for fast development and optimized production builds
- **Type Checking**: TypeScript with strict configuration
- **Database Migrations**: Drizzle Kit for schema management
- **Development Server**: tsx for TypeScript execution in development

### Nostr Relays
The application connects to multiple Nostr relays:
- wss://relay.damus.io
- wss://nos.lol
- wss://relay.nostr.band
- wss://nostr-pub.wellorder.net
- wss://relay.current.fyi

## Deployment Strategy

### Build Process
- **Frontend**: Vite builds the React application to `dist/public`
- **Backend**: esbuild bundles the Express server to `dist/index.js`
- **Database**: Drizzle migrations in `migrations/` directory

### Environment Configuration
- **Development**: NODE_ENV=development with hot reloading
- **Production**: NODE_ENV=production with optimized builds
- **Database**: Requires DATABASE_URL environment variable for PostgreSQL connection

### Deployment Structure
- Static files served from `dist/public`
- API routes prefixed with `/api`
- Single entry point at `dist/index.js` for production
- Database migrations can be applied with `npm run db:push`

The application is designed to be deployed on platforms that support Node.js with PostgreSQL database connectivity, with special considerations for Replit deployment through custom Vite plugins.
