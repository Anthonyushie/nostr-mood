## üéØ What is NostrMood?

NostrMood is a **prediction market application** where users can:

1. **Analyze sentiment** of any Nostr post using advanced sentiment analysis
2. **Create prediction markets** asking "Will this post's sentiment be above 0.6?"
3. **Place Lightning bets** on YES/NO outcomes using any NWC-compatible wallet
4. **Earn Bitcoin** by correctly predicting sentiment outcomes
5. **Share results** directly to Nostr with seamless social integration

### Core Concept

Every market asks the same question: **"Will this post's sentiment score be above 0.6?"**

- **Bet YES**: You think the post is positive (score > 0.6)
- **Bet NO**: You think the post is negative/neutral (score ‚â§ 0.6)
- **Win Bitcoin**: Correct predictions split the losing side's pool
