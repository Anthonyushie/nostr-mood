# ChatGPT Setup for Vercel Deployment

## Step-by-Step Setup Guide

### 1. Add API Routes to Vercel

The ChatGPT API routes are already created in the `/api/chatgpt/` directory:
- `/api/chatgpt/check.ts` - Checks if API key is configured
- `/api/chatgpt/chat.ts` - Handles chat requests

These will automatically work on Vercel without additional configuration.

### 2. Get OpenAI API Key

1. **Create OpenAI Account**
   - Visit [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/signup)
   - Sign up with your email or use Google/Microsoft login

2. **Add Billing Credits**
   - Go to [Billing Settings](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/billing)
   - Click "Add to credit balance"
   - Add at least $5 (this covers thousands of conversations)
   - **Important**: Free trial credits may have expired, you need paid credits

3. **Generate API Key**
   - Visit [API Keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
   - Click "Create new secret key"
   - Name it something like "NostrMood-Production"
   - Copy the key (starts with `sk-`)
   - **Warning**: Save this key securely, you can't view it again

### 3. Configure Vercel Environment Variables

1. **Access Your Vercel Project**
   - Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
   - Select your NostrMood project

2. **Add Environment Variable**
   - Go to Settings â†’ Environment Variables
   - Click "Add New"
   - Name: `OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - Value: `sk-your-actual-api-key-here`
   - Select all environments (Production, Preview, Development)
   - Click "Save"

3. **Redeploy**
   - Go to Deployments tab
   - Click the three dots on the latest deployment
   - Click "Redeploy"
   - Or push a new commit to trigger automatic deployment

### 4. Test the Integration

After deployment:

1. **Visit Your App**
   - Go to your Vercel app URL
   - Analyze a Nostr post to get sentiment results

2. **Check ChatGPT Assistant**
   - Look for the "ChatGPT Assistant" card
   - It should show "AI Powered" badge instead of "API Key Required"

3. **Test Chat**
   - Click "Analyze Current Sentiment" for automatic context
   - Or type a question like "What trading strategies work for this sentiment?"
   - You should get an intelligent AI response

### 5. Troubleshooting

#### "API Key Required" Message
- Check that `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set in Vercel environment variables
- Ensure you redeployed after adding the environment variable
- Verify the key starts with `sk-` and has no extra spaces

#### "API Quota Exceeded" Error
- Add more credits to your OpenAI account at [Billing](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/billing)
- Check your usage at [Usage Dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/usage)
- Free trial credits expire after 3 months

#### "Connection Error"
- Check browser console for network errors
- Verify the API routes are accessible at `your-app.vercel.app/api/chatgpt/check`
- Check Vercel function logs in the dashboard

#### Rate Limiting
- OpenAI has rate limits based on your account tier
- Wait a few minutes between requests
- Consider upgrading your OpenAI plan for higher limits

### 6. Cost Management

#### Understanding Costs
- **Model**: Uses `gpt-3.5-turbo` (cheapest option)
- **Cost**: ~$0.002 per conversation
- **Monthly Usage**: Typical users spend $1-5/month
- **Optimization**: Responses limited to 500 tokens to control costs

#### Monitoring Usage
- Check [OpenAI Usage Dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/usage)
- Set up billing alerts in OpenAI settings
- Monitor costs and adjust if needed

### 7. Advanced Configuration

#### Custom Prompts
The system prompt is optimized for NostrMood and includes:
- Context about sentiment analysis thresholds
- Understanding of prediction markets
- Lightning Network knowledge
- Trading strategy expertise

#### Response Limits
- Max 500 tokens per response
- Temperature set to 0.7 for balanced creativity/accuracy
- Context includes current analysis results

#### Error Handling
- Graceful fallbacks for API failures
- User-friendly error messages
- Detailed logging for debugging

### 8. Security Best Practices

#### Environment Variables
- Never commit API keys to code
- Use Vercel environment variables only
- Rotate keys periodically

#### CORS Configuration
- API routes include proper CORS headers
- Allows requests from your domain
- Blocks unauthorized origins

#### Rate Limiting
- Built-in protection against API abuse
- Reasonable limits for normal usage
- Error handling for quota exceeded
